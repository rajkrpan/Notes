 # Relational Database
  - Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a system for managing data stored in relations. Relation is essentially a mathematical term for table.
  - There are a number of other ways of organizing databases. 
    - Files and directories on Unix-like operating systems form an example of a hierarchical database. 
    - A more modern development is the object-oriented database.
  - Each table is a named collection of rows. Each row of a given table has the same set of named columns, and each column is of a specific data type. Whereas columns have a fixed order in each row, the order of rows within the table is not fixed in any way.
  - Tables are grouped into databases, and a collection of databases managed by a single server instance constitutes a database cluster.

## Commands
  - Commands are not terminated until the semicolon. SQL is case insensitive about key words and identifiers, except when identifiers are double-quoted to preserve the case.

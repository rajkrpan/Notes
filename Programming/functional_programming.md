===Dynamics vs Lexical Scoping==
- Under dynamic scope, if an “unknown” variable is referred to in a function, the idea is to use the version of the variable that is in scope at the time that the function was called (and apply this rule recursively)
- Under lexical scoping rules, if an “unknown” variable is referred to in a function, the idea is to use the version that is “in scope” in the enclosing piece of code (and apply this rule recursively)
a=1
b=2
f<-function(x)
{
  a*x + b
}
g<-function(x)
{
  a=2
  b=1
  f(x)
}
g(2)
- In dynamical scoping answer is 5 in lexical scoping answer is 4
- In lexical scoping variable bindings can be all resolved, checked and verified at compile-time – this is safer, and in many other ways better. Most modern languages adopt lexical scoping, including most functional languages
